## Clipmaner

An easy to use web tool to download your twitch created clips, with advanced filtering and easy to use interface.

Visit https://clipmaner.com/ and login using twitch to start using the tool.
The code is open source, and all data collected is deleted every time the website is used (check the code)

Only this that is stored is a cache (deleted every 7 days) so that twitch doesn't f me in the a.

I **WILL NOT BE** renewing the domanin name since i'm broke. This is supposed to be a "demo" of some sort.
If you want to contribute, please do since this is the only app that does something like this (mainly filtering and downloading of clips).
